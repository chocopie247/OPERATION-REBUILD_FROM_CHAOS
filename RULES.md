## 🌌 1. EVENT OVERVIEW

The **Model Reconstruction Challenge** is an elite, high-intensity machine learning and reverse-engineering competition. Operatives are dropped into a digital scenario where a trained deep residual neural network has been shattered into unlabelled weight matrices and bias tensors. 

```
   [ ORIGINAL TRAINED MODEL ]
               │
               ▼  (Catastrophic Entropy / Corruption Event)
   [ SHUFFLED WEIGHT FRAGMENTS ] ──► (piece_0.pth ... piece_N.pth)
               │
               ▼  (Your Mission: Apply Mathematical Forensics)
   [ PERFECTLY ALIGNED CLASSIFICATION GRID ]
```

This operations exercise has been designed by NSOC to evaluate:
*   **Deep Neural Network Topologies:** Structural mapping of parameters and connections.
*   **Reverse-Engineering Diagnostics:** Analytical heuristics of trained weight variables.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** Search algorithms, matching strategies, and graph reassembly.

---

## 🎯 2. FORENSIC MISSION & OBJECTIVES

A trained residual network model digit categorization head has been compromised. All $N$ constituent linear layers and block parameters have been separated into a chaotic collection (`piece_0.pth` to `piece_N.pth`). 

Your objective is to:
1.  **Analyze the Fragmented Matrix Layers:** Analyze weight shapes, biases, and parameters.
2.  **Match and Pair Components:** Correctly identify and pair input projections with their corresponding output projections.
3.  **Perform Sequential Reassembly:** Discover the precise sequential order of the paired blocks from first ($1$) to last ($K$).
4.  **Restore the Signal Grid:** Reassemble the model so that its predictions align with the original intact model's classification accuracy and output logits.

## ⏳ 3. THE THREE PHASES OF ALIGNMENT

The operational challenge is divided into three distinct chronological stages:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Phase 1: Distribution] -->|Clone Git Repo & Download Packages| B[Phase 2: Reconstruction]
    B -->|Pair Components, Rank Sequences, Optimize Logits| C[Phase 3: Submission]
    C -->|Submit ZIP Payload & After-Action Report| D[Evaluation & Scorecard Generation]
```

### 🛰️ Phase 1: Distribution
Operatives receive the challenge workspace containing shuffled model weights, historical alignment data, verification tools, and starter guidelines.

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Reconstruction
Operatives run exploratory analysis on the raw weights, implement pairing strategies, map the block sequences, and locally test and optimize their reassembled models.

### 📡 Phase 3: Submission
Teams package their reassembled model configurations, pipeline code, and a technical intelligence report, transmitting the final payload to the scoring system.

## 📦 4. OPERATIVE REPOSITORY STRUCTURE & CLONE GUIDE

To streamline deployment and code syncing, all assets are tracked under a local workspace repository. Use the following guidelines to configure your local environment:

```bash
# Clone the central NSOC challenge repository
git clone https://github.com/nsoc-club/model-reconstruction-chaos.git
cd model-reconstruction-chaos

# Spawn your dedicated local Team branch (Do not push to main!)
git checkout -b team-[your_team_name]

# Synchronize development environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📂 Repository Topology

## 📊 5. SECURED TELEMETRY (DATASET ANALYSIS)

The provided calibration dataset serves as intermediate alignment coordinates to verify your reconstruction pipeline.

### 📈 `data/historical_data.csv`
A secured telemetry database capturing representative raw inputs processed by the original intact network:
*   `pixel_0` through `pixel_X`: Normalized input feature coordinates.
*   `pred_logit_0` through `pred_logit_Y`: The classification logits produced by the final head of the pristine network.
*   `true_label`: The actual target classification label.

### 📋 `samples/sample_submission.csv`
A template demonstrating the format for submitting block alignments:
```csv
block_index,inp_piece,out_piece
0,piece_A.pth,piece_B.pth
1,piece_C.pth,piece_D.pth
...
K-1,piece_Y.pth,piece_Z.pth
```

## 🧬 6. DISMANTLED NEURAL CORE (MODEL COMPONENTS)

The scrambled files consist of dictionary states containing weight and bias tensors. They are categorized strictly by their shapes, corresponding to the layers of a deep residual architecture:

*   **Front Projection Layer (`proj`):** Maps input space dimensions $D_{\text{in}}$ down to a latent space dimension $D_{\text{latent}}$.
*   **Output Classification Layer (`last`):** Maps latent space dimensions $D_{\text{latent}}$ to output classes $D_{\text{classes}}$.
*   **Block Input Projections ($W_{\text{in}}$):** Maps latent features $D_{\text{latent}}$ up to a sub-block dimension $D_{\text{sub}}$.
*   **Block Output Projections ($W_{\text{out}}$):** Maps sub-block dimensions $D_{\text{sub}}$ back down to $D_{\text{latent}}$.

### 📐 Residual Block Architecture
Each reconstructed block $k \in [0, K-1]$ maps incoming features $x$ using the following residual logic:

$$\text{Block}_k(x) = x + W_{\text{out}}^{(k)} \operatorname{ReLU}\left(W_{\text{in}}^{(k)} x + b_{\text{in}}^{(k)}\right) + b_{\text{out}}^{(k)}$$

The objective is to discover the correct pairings $(W_{\text{in}}^{(k)}, W_{\text{out}}^{(k)})$ and sequence order $0 \dots K-1$ that reconstructs the network.

## ⚖️ 13. VERIFICATION & ORGANIZERS DISCRETION

> [!IMPORTANT]
